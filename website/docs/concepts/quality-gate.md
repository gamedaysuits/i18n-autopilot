# Quality Gate

Every translation passes through a deterministic validation gate before it's written to disk. The quality gate catches common machine translation failure modes — no silent fallbacks, no garbage written to your locale files.

## Validation Checks

| Check | What It Catches | Gate Label |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| **Empty/blank** | Model returned empty string or whitespace | `[GATE] empty` |
| **Source echo** | Model returned the original English input | `[GATE] source-echo` |
| **Hallucination loop** | Repeated trigram patterns (e.g., `"Qo' Qo' Qo'"`) | `[GATE] hallucination` |
| **Length inflation** | Output is significantly longer than source | `[GATE] length` |
| **Script compliance** | Wrong script for the target locale | `[GATE] script` |

### Empty/Blank

Rejects translations that are empty strings, whitespace-only, or `null`. This catches models that return nothing for difficult keys.

### Source Echo

Detects when the model returns the English source text instead of translating it. Common with short strings and under-specified prompts.

### Hallucination Loop

Analyzes trigram (3-character) patterns in the output. If any trigram repeats more than a threshold number of times relative to the output length, the translation is rejected. This catches degenerate outputs like `"Qo' Qo' Qo' Qo' Qo'"`.

### Length Inflation

Rejects translations where the output length exceeds `maxLengthRatio × source length` (default: 4×). This catches model hallucinations that produce walls of text for a short input.

Configurable via `maxLengthRatio` in your config.

### Script Compliance

For locales with a configured `script` field (e.g., `"script": "cans"` for Plains Cree Syllabics), validates that the output contains non-ASCII characters appropriate for the target script. Latin-only output for an Arabic, CJK, or Syllabics locale is rejected.

## What Happens on Failure

1. The failing translation is logged to stderr with a `[GATE]` prefix, the key name, the reason, and a preview of the value
2. The key is **not** written to the locale file
3. The retry cascade kicks in (see below)

```
[GATE] hero.title: source-echo — "Welcome to our platform"
[GATE] nav.about: hallucination — "À À À À À À À À"
```

## Retry Cascade

When a batch fails (JSON parse error or quality gate rejections), rosetta retries with progressively smaller batches:

```
Full batch (30 keys) → parse error
  └→ Half batch (15 keys) → 2 failures
      └→ Individual keys (1 each) → isolates the 2 problem keys
```

The retry budget is capped by `maxRetries` (default: 3, configurable per-language). This prevents runaway token spend on keys that consistently fail.

After exhausting retries, the problem keys are logged and skipped. They'll be retried on the next `sync` run.

## Prompt Caching

The system message (register, grammar rules, style notes) is split from the user message (the keys to translate). This split is intentional:

- The system message is **identical across batches** for a given locale
- Providers like Anthropic and Google cache repeated system messages
- Result: the first batch pays full token cost, subsequent batches pay only for the user message

This can significantly reduce token costs for projects with many batches.
