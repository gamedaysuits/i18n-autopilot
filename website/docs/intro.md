# i18n-rosetta

A fully customizable internationalization framework. One command translates your locale files. One config controls every method, model, and language pair. And if the built-in methods aren't enough — build your own, prove it works, and deploy it.

```bash
npx i18n-rosetta sync
```

rosetta auto-detects your locale files, format, and target languages. It translates what's missing, skips what's done, validates every result, and writes clean output. That's the starting line.

## Why Not Just Script It Yourself?

You could write a quick loop that calls Google Translate on each key. Most developers do — it takes about 30 lines. Here's where it breaks:

- **No change detection.** Update an English string — the translation stays stale forever. rosetta tracks every source value with SHA-256 hashes and re-translates only what changed.
- **No batching.** One API call per key means 200 keys = 200 round trips. rosetta batches intelligently (configurable, default 30 keys/batch for LLM, 128 for Google).
- **No caching.** Every sync re-translates everything. rosetta's Translation Memory caches translations by source text + locale + method — re-running sync after one key change only translates that one key, not the entire file.
- **No quality gate.** Machine translation hallucinates, echoes the source back, or outputs in the wrong script. rosetta validates every translation before writing it — wrong-script, length inflation, and source echoes are caught and rejected.
- **No format awareness.** Hardcoded to JSON? rosetta handles JSON, TOML, YAML, and Hugo Markdown (frontmatter + body) with auto-detection.
- **No method control.** Every pair gets the same method. rosetta lets you use Google Translate for French, an LLM for Japanese, and a custom community-hosted pipeline for Cree — in the same config file.

rosetta is the production version of that script.

## What Makes It Different

### Every method is a plugin

The translation method is **configurable per language pair**. Mix Google Translate, LLMs, coached prompts, and custom APIs in the same project:

```json title="i18n-rosetta.config.json"
{
  "version": 3,
  "pairs": {
    "en:fr": { "method": "google-translate" },
    "en:ja": { "method": "llm", "model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro" },
    "en:crk": { "methodPlugin": "crk-coached-v1" }
  }
}
```

French gets Google Translate (fast, cheap). Japanese gets a premium LLM (nuanced). Plains Cree gets a coached plugin with grammar rules, dictionaries, and morphological validation. Same `sync` command. Same quality gate. Same CLI.

### Prove it

Think your method can translate English to Spanish? Turkish to Azerbaijani? English to Cree?

**Prove it.** The companion [eval harness](https://mtevalarena.org/docs/specifications/harness) benchmarks any translation method with reproducible, fingerprinted scoring. The [leaderboard](/leaderboard) tracks every submission.

The eval harness and the production CLI share the same plugin interface. A method that scores well in the harness can be used in production — if the community whose language it serves gives consent. For Indigenous and low-resource languages, that consent matters. See [Data Sovereignty](https://mtevalarena.org/docs/sovereignty/data-sovereignty).

```bash
# Benchmark your method (in the eval harness repo)
cd gds-mt-eval-harness
python eval/baseline_experiment.py --dataset data/edtekla-dev-v1.json --submit

# Use it locally
npx i18n-rosetta sync
```

Same plugin. Plug and test.

### The full toolkit

rosetta isn't just `sync`. It's a complete i18n pipeline:

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `sync` | Translate missing, stale, and fallback keys |
| `watch` | Auto-sync when your source file changes |
| `lint` | Scan source code for hardcoded strings |
| `wrap` | Auto-wrap hardcoded strings in `t()` calls |
| `audit` | List all untranslated `[EN]` fallback values |
| `integrity` | Detect placeholder corruption, encoding issues, and ICU plural completeness |
| `seo` | Generate hreflang tags, sitemaps, and JSON-LD schema |
| `status` | Show pair config, plugins, and benchmark scores |
| `provenance` | Audit translation resource licensing |
| `plugin` | Install, remove, and list method plugins |
| `fonts` | Download web fonts for PUA script converters |
| `tm` | Manage Translation Memory cache (stats, clear, per-locale) |
| `xliff` | Export/import XLIFF 1.2 for professional translator review |

Three of these — `lint`, `sync`, `audit` — form a CI pipeline that catches hardcoded strings, translates them, and fails the build if any locale is incomplete.

## The Arena

The [Method Leaderboard](/leaderboard) is the scoreboard. Every submission is fingerprinted to a Git commit, versioned to a specific dataset, and scored by the same harness. Anyone can submit.

**What can you prove?** The harness takes JSON. Plugins take JSON. Any method that produces JSON can be tested:

| Approach | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Coached LLM** | Inject grammar rules and dictionaries into a frontier model's prompt |
| **Fine-tuned model** | Train an open model on parallel text — just not on the eval data |
| **FST-gated pipeline** | LLM generates → finite-state transducer validates morphology → retry |
| **Chained models** | Model A drafts → Model B post-edits → Model C scores |
| **Dictionary + LLM** | Force known terms from a dictionary, let the LLM handle the rest |
| **Evolutionary** | Generate candidates, score them, mutate the best, repeat |
| **Partial translation** | Translate a sample by hand, prove your LLM matches, auto-translate the rest |

Fine-tune models. Deploy evolutionary algorithms. Test student answers on language exams. Build lookup tables. Chain three models together. As long as your method produces JSON, the harness scores it and the framework runs it.

:::danger The one rule
**Do not train on the evaluation data.** Methods exposed to the benchmark dataset will be disqualified. Fine-tune on whatever you want. Just not on the test set.
:::

This is an open invitation. If you work with a low-resource language — as a researcher, a community member, a student, or just someone who cares — build a method, run the harness, and claim the top score. The problem is unsolved. The infrastructure is here.
