/**
 * Watch mode — monitors the source locale file and re-syncs on changes.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: Extracted from sync.js to reduce the god-module
 * and give watch its own lifecycle management.
 *
 * Uses fs.watchFile (stat polling) with a configurable interval, followed
 * by a 500ms debounce to prevent duplicate syncs when editors write in
 * multiple steps (write + rename).
 *
 * WHY fs.watchFile INSTEAD OF fs.watch:
 *   fs.watch relies on kernel-level events (FSEvents on macOS, inotify on
 *   Linux). On macOS, FSEvents is unreliable in /tmp and other special
 *   directories, and can miss events when writeFileSync replaces the inode
 *   (atomic write = write-to-temp + rename). fs.watchFile uses stat polling,
 *   which is slower but works reliably on all platforms and filesystems.
 *   The 500ms polling interval keeps CPU overhead negligible for a single file.

/**
 * Start watch mode — sync once, then re-sync on source file changes.
 *
 * LIFECYCLE:
 *   1. Resolve config and locate the source file
 *   2. Run the initial sync (awaited — completes before watching starts)
 *   3. Set up fs.watchFile on the source file
 *   4. Print [WATCH] Ready to signal the watcher is active
 *   5. Block indefinitely (the returned Promise never resolves until SIGINT)
 *
 * WHY THE PROMISE NEVER RESOLVES:
 *   The CLI dispatcher calls process.exit() after the command's run() resolves.
 *   Watch mode is a long-running process — it must block the run() promise
 *   to prevent the CLI from exiting. SIGINT cleanup handles shutdown.
 *
 * RE-ENTRANCY:
 *   If a change arrives while a sync is already in progress, the change is
 *   queued via `pendingSync`. When the current sync finishes, it checks
 *   `pendingSync` and re-syncs if needed. This prevents both re-entrant
 *   syncs AND silently dropped changes.
 *
 * @param {object} options
 * @param {string} [options.cwd] - Working directory
 * @param {object} [options.cliArgs] - CLI arguments
 * @returns {Promise<never>} Never resolves — blocks until SIGINT
